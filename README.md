An assortment of exploit development related concepts and fundamentals I picked up over my skillbridge. 

- **art_of_exploitation** - A book by Jon Erikson, it teaches some solid fundamentals of exploit development with concepts such as stack based buffer overflow, string substitution exploits, and authoring efficient shellcode all from scratch.
- ***questions** - random questions i ask myself as well as the answer/resource is used to find it.
- **terminal_tools** - a list of terminal tools i find useful for doing this kind of work.
